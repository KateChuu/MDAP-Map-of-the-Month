# MDAP-Map-of-the-Month

- Project team: Amanda Belton, Dr Emily Fitzgerald, Dr Stuart Lee, Sayan Bachhar and me.

- Stakeholders: Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Networkâ€¯(AURIN), Pursuit, and Melbourne Centre for Cities and Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation.
 
-	Project details: Greater Melbourne faces diverse and complex challenges that often go unnoticed by the public and policymakers. The "Map of the Month" project seeks to bring these issues to light through thought-provoking and informative maps based on data from the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN). By activating place-based knowledge and fostering a "metropolitan conversation", the initiative draws attention to pressing metropolitan issues, and profiles experts at the intersection of science and policy.

## T3 Night Workers

- Theme details: I worked on the Map of the Month project on the Night Workers theme. Our team created charts and maps using the data on nurses and midwives, such as population density in the Greater Melbourne area to explore their work and residence patterns. 

-	Data source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and AURIN
